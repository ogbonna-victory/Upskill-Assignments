Everything about <meta charset="UTF-8">:
   In HTML, the "meta" element is used to add metadata to a document. 
Metadata is data that describes the document, like it's title, author, or character encoding.
The "meta" element takes a "name" attribute, which specifies the type of metadata,
 and a "content" attribute, which contains the actual metadata.
In this case, the name attribute is "charset" and the content attribute is "UTF-8".
That means the metadata is character encoding information, and the encoding is UTF-8.

UTF-8 character encoding:
   UTF-8 is an encoding standard that represents every characterin the Unicode standard,
    including charactersin any language.
The Unicode standard is a way of representing every character, letter, 
or symbol ina any language using a unique number called a code point.
So, UTF-8 represents each code point using 1 to 4bytes.
The reason it's so popular is that it's compatible with ASCII, 
so older systems that only support ASCII can still read UTF-8 text,
and it's efficient because it only uses 1 byte for most characters.
It's also the best choice for web developers.

Few Reasons You Should Always Use the "meta" Element to Declare the Character Encoding: 
1. It ensures that the browser displays the text correctly.
 Without the "meta" element, the browser might guess the encoding incorrectly, 
 which could cause broken characters and weird symbols.
 2. It ensures that the search engines can index the content correctly.
 3. It helps accessibility tools read the content correctly.
