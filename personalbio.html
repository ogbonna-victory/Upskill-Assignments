    Hi! My name is Ogbonna Victory Chimaram, 25yrs old. I come from a family of five and the last child.
    I'm a graduate of the National Diploma in Computer
    Science program at Abia State Polytechnic.
      I'm a curious,passionate, and caring person who loves to learn and help others. I'm
      fascinated by the idea of creating things from scratch, and I've found
      that coding and web development is the perfect outlet for my creative
      energy. I'm always up for a challenge and love to learn new things. In my
      spare time, I enjoy reading,playing video games, and spending time with
      friends and family.

    <h2>My Experience So Far At Genesys Upskill Community</h2>
    <p>
      Since i got accepted into the Genesys Upskill Tech Program, I've had a
      fantastic experience. I was invited to join a Discord channel and a
      whatsapp group, where I've met many other aspiring web developers, as well
      as people who are already knowledgeable about web development. They've
      been incredibly supportive and have been sharing helpful online resources
      and tips.I am currently learning CSS and I've already seen significant
      improvements in my coding skills, and I'm excited to continue learning and
      growing with this amazing people. The classes have also been amazing
      thanks to our patient tutor who takes his time to explain things.
      I'm hoping that after this course, i will have a strong foundation in frontend web developer
